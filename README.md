OCaml/JavaScript repl POC
----------------------------

This is a proof of concept of an repl that can evaluate both OCaml and
JavaScript!

</p>

# Installation

You'll need some OCaml packages, 

```
opam install javascriptcore linenoise astring
```

Then just `make`, which should open you up in the repl :)
